    <h2> About us</h2>
    <p>HearTheSphere is an organization started by a group of high school students in Beaconhouse Margalla Islamabad. HearTheSphereâ€™s main objective is to provide our planet the voice that it does not have, to be the an advocate against the cruel actions of its residents. </p>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>When we started this organization, we bore in mind only one goal: the betterment of our planet by working directly for the environment. All around us we can see many atrocities, almost all of which are our own contribution. We consume an estimated hundred million barrels of fuel alone-the production and use of which is dangerously causing non-reversible changes in our environment. Not only that, but we have also contributed to the death of hundreds of thousands of animals, birds and marine life; leading to the extinction of some very exquisite species. Hence, we aim to promote the use of renewable energy resources, cycling and walking, and limiting the use of plastic items. <br> We dream of a world where sustainability is a norm. A world where industries prioritize the environment. A world of hope, achieved better late than never, or the tide of our selfishness will ripple through the future generations. </p>
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Our aim is simple, yet ambitious. We hope to bring change; keeping in mind that every great revolution begins with small steps. We strive to cooperate with different environmental organizations and brands that play their part in promoting eco-friendly products; these organizations are already striving towards a better environment and we can join them by using their metal straws, using the reusable bottles that they sell, and using the mobile applications that they have that will donate towards starving people in less fortunate countries. We aim to raise awareness among the masses so they know the implications of their ignorance. To nudge their hearts and minds towards a greater good. For it is our very determination, our actions-no matter how small, that the future of this world is counting on.  </p>
